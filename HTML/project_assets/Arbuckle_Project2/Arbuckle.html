        Hi there everyone! My name is Jon Arbuckle. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives on earth. Although my pets drives me <span class="first-later">crazy,</span> I can't imagine life without them.
        
        <p>
            I spend about half my time going to the grocery stores to buy enough foods to feed Garfield. I like marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <span class="first-line">lots and lots</span> of lasanga. When I come home, Garfield usually comes seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <span class="first-later">I wasn't too happy about that.</span> 
        </p>
