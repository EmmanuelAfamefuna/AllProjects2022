### Question 06:

### Question A:
My paragraph tags in the index.html file are supposed to have a background color of aqua blue but instead I am getting white backgrounds. Please fix this and explain why the background colors were white instead (what CSS rule took place?). No more than a sentence needed for the explanation.

### Answer A: It was white because the backgroundcolor was not specified. That was CSS specifications that took place



### Question B: 
"Paragraph 2" is supposed to have a bold text but for some reason it is not. Please fix this and comment below what was happening that stopped the bold font from happening.

### Answer B: It happened because id of unique was targeted. However, ID has more weight than CLASS
